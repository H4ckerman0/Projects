# Projects
This is a collection of all my smaller projects.
All of them were coding exercises provided by the book "Python f√ºr Einsteiger" made by the german author Florian Dalwigk.
Everysingle has command line interface and can be run with the terminal.
The "E-Mail-Sender" doesnt work properly due to default safety configurations from the E-Mail-Clients, but you can still have a look at the source code.
